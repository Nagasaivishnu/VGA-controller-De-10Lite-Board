# VGA-controller-De-10Lite-Board
Operating VGA operable Monitor Using De-10 Lite FPGA and Quartus Prime Toll

This project is for understanding how VGA protocol Works and Using these Verilog files you can able to Display one color on the monitor

These project files are simulated in quartus prime tool using De-10 Lite FPGA Board and output is as expected
